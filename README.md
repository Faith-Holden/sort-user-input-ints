# sort-user-input-ints

My solution for Chapter 7 Exercise 5 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
Write a program that will read a sequence of positive real numbers entered by the user
and will print the same numbers in sorted order from smallest to largest. The user will
input a zero to mark the end of the input. Assume that at most 100 positive numbers
will be entered. Do not use any built-in function such as Arrays.sort(). Do the sorting
yourself.

Notes: TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
